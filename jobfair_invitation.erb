Dear <%= @recruiter.first_name %>,

We're excited to extend an invitation to <%= @recruiter.company_name %> to attend this year's annual ACM@UIUC Career Week. The career fair will be held on Wednesday, September 27th, right before the Reflections|Projections tech conference. ACM@UIUC is the largest ACM student chapter in the US, and with over 1,700 students coming every year to the ACM career fair, and we would love to have <%= @recruiter.company_name %> be involved.

The lowest tier level, Megabyte, will look almost the same as getting a spot at
the job fair in the past, and the price is $1,300.

The Megabyte sponsorship tier includes the following:
 - A booth in the Siebel Center Atrium
 - Meals during the event
 - Shipping and logistics help
 - Parking during the event

You can view all the available tiers and options at http://reflectionsprojections.com/#/sponsor

If you're interested in sponsoring at a higher level than Megabyte, please reach out to us at corporate@acm.illinois.edu.

The official job fair registration form can be accessed at:

You must login to the website to access the registration form. Your credentials are:

Thank You,

<%= @username %>
ACM Corporate Committee
