Dear <%= recruiter.first_name %>,

We're excited to extend an invitation to <%= recruiter.company_name %> to attend this year's annual ACM@UIUC Career Week. The startup fair will be held on Tuesday, September 26th, 2017. ACM@UIUC  is the largest ACM student chapter in the US, and with over 1,700 students coming every year to the ACM career fair, and we would love to have <%= recruiter.company_name %> be involved.

The lowest tier level, Megabyte, will look almost the same as getting a spot at
the job fair in the past. The price is the same, at $500.

Registration ensures:
- A booth in the Siebel Center atrium, home of the Computer Science department.
- Complimentary meals for the entire weekend
- Help with shipping and logistics
- Free parking
- Advertising for <%= recruiter.company_name %> in the Reflections | Projections program and on the website

If you're interested in purchasing any of our a la carte options, please reach out to us at corporate@acm.illinois.edu.
